Each week, Sue will present recommendations in a Tinder-like interface—we'll simply swipe right to accept or left to reject suggestions. Once the menu is finalized, Sue will send the recipe URLs to \u003C href=\" https://xnham.com/#expeditr\">Expeditr\u003C/a>, which will consolidate all ingredients into one convenient shopping list.
