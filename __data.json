This works well for most users since they rarely receive more than one video on the same day. However, there's a special category of users: coaches. They often need to review videos from multiple players and courts, which means they could easily receive more than ten email notifications within a few hours. This is, of course, overwhelming.\n\nPre-AI, I would have had to hand this problem off to professional developers. It would have resulted in weeks of code updates and QA testing. This time, I decided to build a solution myself.\n\nUsing Mailgun and Node.js as my main tools, I created an email interceptor that operates outside the existing system's codebase. It replaces individual notifications with two simple emails: \"first video ready\" (so coaches know to start checking) and \"all videos complete.\" The interceptor includes a web admin interface for managing email templates and batching configurations.\n\nI built this solution in just a few days, saving thousands of dollars and weeks of development time.
