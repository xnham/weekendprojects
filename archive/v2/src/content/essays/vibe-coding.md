Vibe coding rules:
1. Break it down. Modularize - keep AI focused. Take the time to break down your project in the correct way.
2. Remember that AI likes to be verbose and complete. Always explicitly limit its scope--say what it doesn't need to worry about and why. (The "why helps it predict other things it shouldn't worry about.)
3. Read the thinking process. You may spot obvious misunderstandings.
4. If AI can't solve a problem after a few attempts, start a new chat and try a different approach.
5. Always explicitly tell it to ask, not guess or assume.
