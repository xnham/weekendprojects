                        <p>Building and maintaining software used to be expensive, which meant custom solutions were mainly accessible to large enterprises. That's changing fast. Soon, anyone will be able to create production-grade software using everyday language. It will become completely normal for small businesses, families, and even individuals to deploy bespoke software that's precisely tailored—even adaptive—to their needs.</p>

                        <p>We are entering the era of the software long tail, and Weekend Projects is my exploration of this future.</p>

                        <p>In late 2024, empowered by Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools, I started building software to squash various small yet pesky problems that were bugging me and my family.</p>

                    <div class="column">
                        <p>Before the advent of these powerful AI assistants, owing to my meager coding skills, I would've had to hire a developer to build "software for one," which would have been a silly use of resources.</p>

                        <p>What great fun it is to see that the economic forces are now enabling, even favoring, hyperpersonal software creation. This ushers us into truly human-centric design, where           technology molds to our natural behavior, not the other way around.</p>

                        <p>I hope you enjoy browsing through my weekend projects ↓</p>
