                    <p>Building and maintaining software used to be expensive, which meant custom solutions were mainly accessible to large enterprises. That's changing fast. Soon, anyone will be able to create production-grade software using everyday language. It will become completely normal for small businesses, families, and even individuals to deploy bespoke software that's precisely tailored—even adaptive—to their needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are entering the golden era of the software long tail, and Weekend Projects is my exploration of this future.

                    <p>In mid-2024, empowered by Claude, Cursor, and other AI tools, I started building software to squash various small yet pesky problems that were bugging me and my family. Before the advent of these powerful AI assistants, owing to my meager coding skills, I would've had to hire a developer to build "software for one," which would have been a silly use of resources.

                    What great fun it is to see that the economic forces are now enabling, even favoring, hyperpersonal software creation. This ushers us into truly human-centric design, where technology molds to our natural behavior, not the other way around.
                    </p>
