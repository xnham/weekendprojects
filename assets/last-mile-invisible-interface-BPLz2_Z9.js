This wasn’t an oversight—it was deliberate. Despite being a “tech company,” we discovered that the best technology often stays out of the way completely.</p> <p>When we first entered the tennis video market, we assumed we’d need to build a dashboard for club managers. But as we spoke with clients, we observed something striking: tennis clubs, despite operating in the same industry, functioned in remarkably different ways. One club wanted to automatically send videos to every member, but exclude non-members. Another preferred an on-demand model with optional subscriptions. A third focused exclusively on their junior program, where the head pro wanted specific edits from tournament days. Even when clubs used identical court booking software, their implementation varied dramatically—some primarily scheduled private lessons, while others ran large group clinics across multiple courts.</p> <p>Individual players showed equally diverse habits. Some arrived ten minutes before their scheduled time; others routinely showed up twenty minutes late. Some practiced structured drills; others preferred casual rallies. Among those playing competitive points, scoring systems varied widely, with most players occasionally losing track of the score anyway. These idiosyncrasies make humans wonderfully human—and make the concept of one-interface-fits-all fundamentally flawed.</p> <p>Instead of forcing our clients to learn yet another system, we adapted our technology to their existing workflows. We integrated with their court booking platforms. When manual inputs were unavoidable, we leveraged tools they already used—Google Sheets, email, or text messages. We created invisible connections between these familiar interfaces and our background systems, crafting custom solutions that felt natural because they matched what people were already doing.</p> <p>This approach stemmed partly from personal observation: we live in an app-saturated world where each application demands we learn its unique interface patterns. Even as someone comfortable with technology, I’ve felt the mental fatigue of memorizing another set of buttons, menus, and gestures. This “interface fatigue” is real—it’s the cognitive tax we pay with each new digital tool we adopt.</p> <p>The challenge extends beyond mere convenience into what I call the “last mile problem.” Many organizations have solvable technical problems but lack the expertise to implement solutions. Take live streaming tennis matches: the technology exists and isn’t particularly complex, but many clubs struggle to find anyone comfortable enough with technology to set it up. The problem isn’t challenging enough to justify hiring a specialist but remains just beyond the comfort zone of existing staff. Consequently, these “small” problems remain perpetually unsolved, despite being technically solvable.</p> <p>This is where AI becomes particularly exciting. First, AI dramatically reduces development costs, making custom solutions economically viable for small organizations or even individuals. Second, AI-infused interfaces can adapt to users over time, gradually conforming to their preferences and habits. Instead of users learning software, software can finally learn users.</p> <p>The best interface might be the one you never notice—technology that fits so naturally into your existing workflow that it feels like an extension of yourself rather than another system to master. In a world of increasingly complex tools, perhaps the most sophisticated approach is making technology sophisticated enough to disappear.</p>",1);function p(e){var t=n();o(e,t)}export{p as default,s as metadata};
