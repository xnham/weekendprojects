          <span id="hide" class="svelte-p0121w">Surprised by the meaningful impact they delivered, particularly

          faltered not because of technical shortcomings but because there
          was no interface capable of delivering it smoothly to users with
          complex and diverse behaviors, creating a &#39;<a href="/writing/the-last-mile" class="essay-card-link">last mile</a>&#39; problem. This observation made me feel excited about AI&#39;s

          Later, I managed a neurobiology laboratory and helped develop
          case-based medical training simulations at Harvard Medical School. I
          then pursued a PhD at Wharton, where I built computational models to
          study how different choices and attributes help people learn better
          and make more accurate predictions. While at Wharton, I was also introduced to complexity science through a summer program at the Santa Fe Institute.</p> <span id="hide" class="svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w">In grad school, I spent a summer month at the Santa Fe Institute,
          where I was introduced to complexity science. I loved its premise:
          that universal principles can govern systems as different as ant
          colonies, economies, and weather systems. It gave me a new way to look
          past rigid disciplinary boundaries and synthesize insights across
          them.</p></span> <p class="svelte-p0121w">Around 2015, I received my green card, which allowed me to pursue projects outside academia. After years of theoretical work, I was eager to
          create something that delivered value directly to people.
          Tennis happened to be my obsession at the time, and I observed a need
          in the tennis community that prompted me to start Ocams.</p></div></div> <div class="about-row svelte-p0121w"><div class="about-timeline svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w"><span class="arrow svelte-p0121w">←</span> <span class="year svelte-p0121w">all that</span></p></div> <div class="about-content svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w">I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia.</p></div></div></div>`;return{c(){e=l("div"),e.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){e=r(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-fvmzo7"&&(e.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){c(e,"class","container")},m(t,n){d(t,e,n)},p:s,i:s,o:s,d(t){t&&v(e)}}}function f(a){return m(()=>{w({title:"About | Wendy Ham's Weekend Projects",description:"From academia to tennis and software.",type:"profile",canonicalUrl:"https://xnham.com/about"})}),[]}class _ extends u{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,f,y,i,{})}}export{_ as component};
