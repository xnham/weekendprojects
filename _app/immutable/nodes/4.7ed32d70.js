          Later, I managed a neurobiology laboratory and helped develop
          case-based medical training simulations at Harvard Medical School. I
          then pursued a PhD at Wharton, where I built computational models to
          study how different choices and attributes help people learn better
          and make more accurate predictions. While at Wharton, I was also introduced to complexity science through a summer program at the Santa Fe Institute.</p> <span id="hide" class="svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w">In grad school, I spent a summer month at the Santa Fe Institute,
          where I was introduced to complexity science. I loved its premise:
          that universal principles can govern systems as different as ant
          colonies, economies, and weather systems. It gave me a new way to look
          past rigid disciplinary boundaries and synthesize insights across
          them.</p></span> <p class="svelte-p0121w">Around 2015, I received my green card, which allowed me to pursue projects outside academia. After years of theoretical work, I was eager to
          create something that delivered value directly to people.
          Tennis happened to be my obsession at the time, and I observed a need
          in the tennis community that prompted me to start Ocams.</p></div></div> <div class="about-row svelte-p0121w"><div class="about-timeline svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w"><span class="arrow svelte-p0121w">←</span> <span class="year svelte-p0121w">all that</span></p></div> <div class="about-content svelte-p0121w"><p class="svelte-p0121w">I grew up in Jakarta, Indonesia in a family that ran an egg business.</p></div></div></div>`;return{c(){e=l("div"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(s){e=r(s,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(e)!=="svelte-1rq0pdq"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){c(e,"class","container")},m(s,o){d(s,e,o)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(s){s&&v(e)}}}function f(t){return m(()=>{w({title:"About | Wendy Ham's Weekend Projects",description:"From academia to tennis and software.",type:"profile",canonicalUrl:"https://xnham.com/about"})}),[]}class _ extends u{constructor(e){super(),h(this,e,f,y,i,{})}}export{_ as component};
