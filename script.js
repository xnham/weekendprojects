Well... that rarely worked.</p></br><p>A big reason why was that we had no real-time insight into where we stood against our budget. What we needed was a simple daily expense report. Yet, I couldn\'t find a personal finance app that would send alerts about just a few custom, discretionary categories.</p></br><p>So I built a simple solution called Miss Penny: It sends a text daily at 8 AM showing how we\'re tracking against our eating and shopping budgets.',
